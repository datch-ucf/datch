The Documenting and Triaging Cultural Heritage (DATCH) project is an open-source platform for field assessment and documentation of built and movable cultural heritage using mixed reality hardware. DATCH allows real-time overlay comparisons of cultural heritage against earlier documentation while also enabling the creation of new scaled drawings using gestures, even in field situations with no network connections. DATCH will aid rapid needs assessments of cultural heritage in conflict situations, ongoing assessments of cultural heritage in the field, and enable fieldwork across multiple disciplines. The prototype software will be developed and field tested with Microsoftâ€™s HoloLens, but with a goal of cross-platform compatibility across head mounted display mixed reality devices.
